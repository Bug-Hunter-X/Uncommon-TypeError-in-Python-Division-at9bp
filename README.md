This repository demonstrates a subtle TypeError that can occur in Python when performing division. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` is designed to handle typical errors like division by zero and division involving strings. However, it fails when provided with non-numeric, non-string inputs, such as lists or other custom objects. This example highlights the importance of thorough error handling and input validation in Python, especially when dealing with potentially diverse data types.  The solution shows how to enhance the function to explicitly check for numeric types using `isinstance` before proceeding with the division.
